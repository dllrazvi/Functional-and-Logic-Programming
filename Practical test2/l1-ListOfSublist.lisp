;Write a function to determine the list of all sublists of a given list, on any level.      
; A sublist is either the list itself, or any element that is a list, at any level. Example:
; (1 2 (3 (4 5) (6 7)) 8 (9 10)) => 5 sublists :    
; (  (1 2 (3 (4 5) (6 7)) 8 (9 10))    (3 (4 5) (6 7))     (4 5)   (6 7)   (9 10) ) 

(defun allSublists (l)
  (cond
    ((atom l) nil)
    (T (apply 'append (list l) (mapcar 'allSublists l)))
  )
)
