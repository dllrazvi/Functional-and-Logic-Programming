# Functional and Logic Programming â€“ Course Summary
This repository includes all the assignments and exercises for the Functional and Logic Programming course, focused on building problem-solving skills using two paradigms: functional programming with LISP and logic programming with Prolog.

## Course Overview
The course was structured into two main parts:

### 1. Functional Programming with LISP
- Focused on recursive problem-solving

- Practiced working with:

-- Lists, atoms, symbols

-- Higher-order functions and lambda expressions

-- Tail recursion and efficient recursive patterns

-- Basic functional operations: mapcar, reduce, filter, member, append

- Exercises included:

-- List manipulation (filtering, mapping, sorting)

-- Recursive numerical algorithms (factorial, Fibonacci)

-- Processing nested lists and tree-like structures

### 2. Logic Programming with Prolog
- Introduced declarative programming through Prolog

- Covered:

-- Defining facts and rules

-- Recursive rule building

-- List processing via pattern matching

-- Backtracking and unification mechanisms

- Exercises included:

-- Solving logical puzzles

-- Implementing relations (e.g., family trees)

-- List-based operations (e.g., length, append, reverse)

-- Simple AI-like logical deductions

## Skills Gained
- Mastered recursion-heavy thinking for solving problems functionally

- Learned to build programs through pattern matching and inference rules

- Improved algorithmic thinking through minimalist, functional code

- Understood logic-based reasoning and search strategies through Prolog

- Experience in purely declarative programming, avoiding side-effects

- Adapted to two non-mainstream paradigms, valuable for improving flexibility in thinking
